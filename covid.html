         <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 9 May 2021, more than 157 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.28 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly variable, ranging from none to life-threateningly severe. Transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly when an infected person is in close contact[b] with another person.[8][9] Small droplets containing the virus leave an infected person as they breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak and enter another person via their mouth, nose, or eyes. Airborne transmission can also occur, with smaller infected droplets lingering in the air for minutes to hours within enclosed spaces that have inadequate ventilation.[9] Less commonly, the virus may spread via contaminated surfaces.[9] People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop any symptoms.[10][11]

Recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation and air-filtering, hand washing, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic. Several vaccines have been developed and widely distributed since December 2020. Current treatments focus on addressing symptoms, but work is underway to develop therapeutic drugs that inhibit the virus. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns/quarantines, workplace hazard controls, and business closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.[12]

The pandemic has resulted in significant global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.[13] It has led to widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, agricultural disruption, and food shortages. However, there have also been decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Numerous educational institutions and public areas have been partially or fully closed, and many events have been cancelled or postponed. Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media. The pandemic has raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights.</p>

         <p>Although the exact origin of the virus is still unknown, the first outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China in late 2019. Many early cases of COVID-19 were linked to people who had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan,[14][15][16] but it is possible that human-to-human transmission was already happening before this.[17][18] On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease "COVID-19", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019.[19][20] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[21] pangolin coronaviruses,[22][23] and SARS-CoV.[24] Scientific consensus is that COVID-19 is a zoonotic virus that arose from bats in a natural setting,[25][26][27] although the exact original host and cross-species infection routes remain in need of further investigation.[17] Despite this, the subject has generated a significant amount of online conspiracy theories,[28][18] which were amplified by rapidly growing online echo chambers.[29]

The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.</p>

         <p>The virus is transmitted mainly through the respiratory route after an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. A new infection occurs when virus-containing particles exhaled by an infected person, either respiratory droplets or aerosols, get into the mouth, nose, or eyes of other people who are in close contact with the infected person.[123] During human-to-human transmission, an average 1000 infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection.

The closer people interact, and the longer they interact, the more likely they are to transmit COVID-19. Closer distances can involve larger droplets (which fall to the ground) and aerosols, whereas longer distances only involve aerosols. Larger droplets can also turn into aerosols (known as droplet nuclei) through evaporation. The relative importance of the larger droplets and the aerosols is not clear as of November 2020; however, the virus is not known to spread between rooms over long distances such as through air ducts. Airborne transmission is able to particularly occur indoors, in high risk locations such as restaurants, choirs, gyms, nightclubs, offices, and religious venues, often when they are crowded or less ventilated. It also occurs in healthcare settings, often when aerosol-generating medical procedures are performed on COVID-19 patients.

The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies; as of September 2020 it was estimated that one infected person will, on average, infect between two and three other people. This is more infectious than influenza, but less so than measles. It often spreads in clusters, where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location. There is a major role of "super-spreading events", where many people are infected by one person. A person who is infected can transmit the virus to others up to two days before they themselves show symptoms, and even if symptoms never appear.[123] People remain infectious in moderate cases for 7â€“12 days, and up to two weeks in severe cases. In October 2020, medical scientists reported evidence of reinfection in one patient.</p>
